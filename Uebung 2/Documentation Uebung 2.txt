(I) The client get asked for the file to look for.
(II) The server checks if the file is there and respondes if true with 'EXISTS' and the size of the file and 'ERR' otherwise.
(III) The client decides if he wants to download the file. If he wants to, the response is 'OK'
(IV) The server sends the data and the client saves the file with the prefix 'new_'

Bug: 
I created a file called 'test.txt' in the same folder where the scripts are, but it was not able to find it, what drived me nearly crazy.
After i tried it with the name of the script himself (Client.py) it worked. I can't figure out why it doesnt work for txt-files.
